## What is this?
This repository contains various examples of code snippets to be used in the creation of Page Manager templates. Most of it requires minimal configuration but more advanced example may also be supplied.

## What's available?
*Like Meter*    
A JavaScript snippet to allow the easy creation of a fan meter (visual representation of percent of fans towards a goal).  
*All Channel Fan Gate*  
Our traditional fan gate is only available on Facebook tabs but you can use these code samples to extend the same functionality across a canvas page or microsite. This method does require you get permission from the user to check their likes.
